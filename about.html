           <h2> Hi, My name is Kayla! </h2>
           <p>
            I am just a small-town girl from Macon,Georgia down south. My aspiring dream is to become a creative content director, creating content that expresses a persons vision and also 
            brings it to life. The goal is to flourish in this business and make my mark! Joining F.I.R.S.T Institute was the first step into taking action! However, so far this journey has been beautiful,
            exciting, and challenging but I am up ready for it. Over the past 2 years, i've had the opportunity to create ideas and make shoots for people. Check out my work in my gallery for more!
