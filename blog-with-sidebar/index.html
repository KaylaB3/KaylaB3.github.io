            In the expression 'art of living' the word 'art' refers to skill and 'living' to a manner of life. 
            (Webster's Collegiate Dictionary). The phrase denotes the capability of leading a good life. A life-artist is someone who makes the most of it, given external conditions for existence
            The great art of life is sensation, to feel that we exist, even in pain. However, life is beautiful and a journney through many experiences. We sometimes take life for granted, not realizing 
            the art of life. Meaning, we dont appreciate the lows and value the highs. What is life about? Life is about being here so that we can continue to live, adapt, learn, and grow. A purpose of life, and our purpose, is to continue to evolve.
            We can be whoever we want, whenever we want and wake up trying something new again.
